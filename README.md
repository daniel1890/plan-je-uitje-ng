## Details about project

This project was inspired by a project I made for school together with a few other students. The application should allow the user to select several places in their nearby location, for the selected locations a user should be able to generate a route so they know what path to take between the selected places.

## Dependencies this project uses to realize requirements

### Angular

To create a front-end Angular is used.

### Leaflet

To generate a world map the Leaflet plugin together with the Leaflet-NG plugin are used.

### Tailwindcss
